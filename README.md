This project compares the data between two CSV files.

- The data in both files doesnâ€™t need to be ordered.

- You can choose which columns are the unique key, and the program will search for the same key in the second file and compare.

- You can choose which columns you'd like to ignore for the data comparison.

- The system will show different records.

- The system will show the records existing in one file and not in the other.
